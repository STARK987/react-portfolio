# Clone and Use 📋

- The website is completely built on `react-js` library of `javascript` and that's why we need `nodejs` and `npm` installed
- While installing `nodejs` and `npm`, try to install versions which are equal or greater than the versions mentioned in badges above
- In case you want to help developing it or simply saving it, you can fork the repository just by clicking the button on the top-right corner of this page
- After the successful installation of `nodejs` and `npm`, clone the repository into your local system using below command:
  ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ashutosh1919/masterPortfolio.git
  ```
  This will clone the whole repository in your system.
- To download required dependencies to your system, navigate to the directory where the cloned repository resides and execute following command:
  ```node
  npm install
  ```
- Now the project is ready to use
- You can check it using `npm start`, it will open the website locally on your browser.


### package.json

Open this file, which is in the main cloned directory, choose any "name" and change "homepage " to `https://<your-github-username>.github.io`. Do not forget the `https://`, otherwise fonts will not load.

## Other

- You need to change the website title and other descriptions in `public/index.html`
- You can define your own favicon in `public/icons` directory. If you don't have a favicon, you can generate favicons from [Favicon Generator](https://www.favicon-generator.org/) and [Favicon IO](https://favicon.io/)
- You can also edit your website preview (known as description image). Run your site locally, take a screenshot and replace with `public/icons/desc.png`. Note that your screenshot should be 1280x640 for better preview.

# Choose Theme 🌈

- You can take a look at `src/theme.js` file where all available themes are mentioned with their respective color codes
- At the bottom of this file you will see the below code:
  - `export const chosenTheme = blueTheme;`
  - You need to change the name from `blueTheme` to whatever theme you want to set your website to
  - You can define new theme similarly as other themes and you can assign name of that new defined theme to `chosenTheme`
- That's it. You just need to change the theme name and the code will take care of everything else
- Run `npm start` to check if everything is ok.

# Deployment 📦

- Once you are done with your setup and have successfully completed all steps above, you need to put your website online!
- I highly recommend using [Github Pages](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages) to achieve this the EASIEST WAY.
- To deploy your website, you have two options. First you need to create a github repository with the name `<your-github-username>.github.io`. Please don't give it any other name.
- Now, you need to generate a production build and deploy the website.

**Option 1:**

- Run `npm run build` to generate the production build folder.
- Enter the build folder, `git init` and push the generated code to the `master` branch of your new repository on github. That's it. It's Done.
- You may need to `git init` and force push at every new build.

**Option 2 (will not work with [user pages](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages)):**

- Run `npm run deploy` to build and create a branch called `gh-pages`. It will push the `build` files to that branch.
- The last step in deploying is to enable `Github Pages` in settings of the repository and select `gh-pages` branch.

Now, your website is successfully deployed and you can visit it at `<your-github-username>.github.io`.  
If you are stuck somewhere and want to observe the deployment process in depth, then please watch below video.
